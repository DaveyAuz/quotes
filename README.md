# quotes

## Lab 08

## Setup
Create a new repository for this partnered lab; call it quotes. In that repo, add a .gitignore file from the course repo, and then run gradle init --type java-application.

## Feature Tasks
Use the file recentquotes.json to show random popular book quotes. Your program should use GSON to parse the .json file. The app needs no functionality other than showing the quote and the author when it is run. The app should choose one quote each time it is run.

## Testing
Use JUnit to write at least one test for each of the Feature Tasks.
